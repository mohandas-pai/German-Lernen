The following is the present app description on the play store, please update the new one here and i will do the same on app store

Ever wanted to learn german but felt that there are too many tables to remember.

Worry not, this application contains all these tables that are important to A1 and A2 level of german available at your finger tips!!

Tables like
->Article table
->Modal Verbs
->Prepositions
->Adjective Ending tables
and more

I recently completed my A2 level, hence i will be updating the app as and when i learn new chapters in the language.

If you have found any mistakes, wrong information, or want me to add more datas in the app kindly contact me and i will fix/add them.

The app contains important tables and grammar related to A1 and A2 level of Deutsch.

Any help on the following issues would be helpful, will also try and give a shout-out in the app.
